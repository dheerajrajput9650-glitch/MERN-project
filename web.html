        <h1>Mahatma Gandhi</h1>

        <p>Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, was a pivotal leader in India's struggle for independence from British rule.
 He championed nonviolent resistance, a philosophy he called Satyagraha, which emphasized truth and non-violence as powerful tools for social and political change.
 Gandhi led significant movements like the Salt March in 1930, protesting the British salt tax, and the Quit India Movement in 1942, which galvanized the nation.
 His commitment to simplicity, truth, and social justice, including fighting against untouchability, deeply influenced India and inspired global movements for civil rights.
 He was assassinated on January 30, 1948, but his legacy as the "Father of the Nation" endures as a beacon of peace and non-violent resistance</p>

        <p>Bhagat Singh was a prominent Indian revolutionary and freedom fighter born on September 28, 1907, in Punjab.
 He dedicated his life to the Indian independence movement, joining the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), later renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA).
 Influenced by socialist ideals and inspired by figures like Kartar Singh Sarabha, he believed in armed resistance against British rule due to the perceived failure of non-violent methods.
 He was involved in significant acts, including the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi in 1929.
 After being arrested, he was tried and executed on March 23, 1931, at the age of 23.
 He became a martyr, symbolizing resistance and sacrifice, and his final words, "They may kill me but they cannot kill my ideas," remain iconic.
 His legacy endures as a national hero</p>

 His contributions were also vital to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he served as Project Director for the SLV-III, which successfully launched the Rohini satellite into orbit in 1980.
 A passionate advocate for education and youth empowerment, Dr. Kalam inspired millions through his books, such as "Wings of Fire," and his interactions with students.
